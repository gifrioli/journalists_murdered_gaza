            Data from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) warn that the war in Gaza has already left at least 164 journalists dead, with hundreds more still under investigation.
            The conflict, which began on October 7, 2023 — and has not yet ended — has become the deadliest ever recorded for media professionals since 1992.
        </p>
        <p>
            Journalists are civilians and are protected by International Law during the exercise of their work. Deliberate attacks against these professionals constitute a war crime.
            The CPJ portal
            <a href="https://cpj.org/2023/10/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>
            that the majority of those killed are Palestinians, while two of the journalists murdered are Israelis.
            Furthermore, more than 200 reporters have been injured, are missing, or detained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The group of journalists killed in the war between Israel and Hamas represents the number of reporters in a large newsroom in Brazil.
            Newspapers like Folha de S. Paulo or Estadão, which have national circulation and about 200 to 300 journalists,
            would lose the majority of their reporters in just two years.

            With the collected data, it was possible to visualize the severity of journalist deaths in the territory considered between Israel and Palestine.
            The CPJ reports that, since the beginning of the war, journalists have been working without protection, equipment, international presence,
            communication, and with shortages of water and food.

            Deaths of journalists in Gaza accounted for 74% of all deaths worldwide in recent years.
            In 2024, the number broke the record, reaching 76 people.
            By July of this year, 23 had been killed in the war.
            Despite the official CPJ count, the number of professionals may exceed 200, according to the estimate by the NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
