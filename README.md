# Journalists Cut Short
üñäÔ∏è Gaza has become a graveyard for reporters during the war.

Project 2, Lede Program 2025
This repository has a dataset and HTML code for my second project in the Lede Program for Data Journalism at Columbia University.

# Project 
Based on the data and tables provided by the Committee to Protect Journalists, I tried to develop an individual visualization of journalists killed in the war in Gaza between 2023 and 2025.  This is a beginner visualization project, but it was valuable for my learning.

You can access the project [here](https://gifrioli.github.io/journalists_murdered_gaza/).

# Data
All data used in this project come from the monitoring conducted by CPJ. You can access the database [here](https://cpj.org/data/killed/2025/?status=Killed&motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&type%5B%5D=Journalist&start_year=2025&end_year=2025&group_by=location). To extract the table from the website, I performed web scraping on the page.

# Learning
I had difficulty developing the D3.js charts, and because of that, it took me quite a long time to make only two. One of them includes the journalists' names individually, and the other is a world map. I also had difficulties with CSS, but I intend to improve that.
